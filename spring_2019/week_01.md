## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I was able to log into and out of SIS with Postman. I also learned about how to run the expo app for the project. I also wrote a routine for logging out and for accessing the student menu.

## This Week's Plan

> After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to work on learning node.js properly, instead of just winging it entirely. 

## Anything Blocking?

> I think I've been relying on existing code heavily to write code, so I'm going to try to look into node.js code.

## Notes

> None.
