## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I was able to log into and out of SIS with Postman. I also learned about how to run the expo app for the project.

## This Week's Plan

> After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to get my SIS account unlocked after being banned for logging in with Postman, and start work on logging into and out of SIS through the app.

## Anything Blocking?

> I've been locked out of SIS, so I can't actually make progress on moving forward with Postman and SIS. 

## Notes

> None.
