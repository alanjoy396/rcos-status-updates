## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I worked on getting data from the SIS website and creating routes to take that data and store it, so that the frontend could then output it. I worked on getting the grades this week.

## This Week's Plan

> I intend to work further on getting the data from SIS and storing it on the backend. 

## Anything Blocking?

> I have some deadlines on work coming up, so I might not be able to make much progress.

## Notes

> None.
