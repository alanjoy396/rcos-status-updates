## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I helped work on the presentation this week. I also worked on the registration API a bit more, to iron out issues that will come up eventually. 

## This Week's Plan

> I intend to work on the presentation some more, and maybe look into making a dockerfile that makes the project work.

## Anything Blocking?

> Still can't register, so we can't test any of the registration API.

## Overall wrap-up

> Overall, I think I got a decent amount done. I didn't learn as much JavaScript and Node.js as I expected, so I still had trouble with the coding, but I still was able to get a lot of coding done. 
I worked on the logout API, the get_grades API, and the course registration API. I wasn't able to finish the course registration API, so the work on it is in the Course_Registration branch of schedj-backend.
I tried to get the env.js file in the front end to automatically retrieve the public ip of the computer so that new contributors wouldn't have to configure the env.js file every time they connect to the internet, but I found out that wasn't possible, because the phone would look for its own public ip, rather than the computer's.
