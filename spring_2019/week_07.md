## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Got the get_grades api working. It now correctly gathers the data. 

## This Week's Plan

> Need to store the data in an array of objects representing each row in the grades table, rather than having each column as an array. 

## Anything Blocking?

> The Op Sys HW... and Exam this Thursday... It's rough.

## Notes

> None.
