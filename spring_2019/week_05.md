## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Over Spring Break, I didn't do that much. Over the past week, I figured out how to send drop and register requests to SIS.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I intend to translate those drop and register request to actual javascript code. 

## Anything Blocking?

> I'm having a little trouble getting Git to pull the latest version of the code, because it says I have commits to push, and I don't know how to delete those, and I can't actually push them because the master branch is locked to actual requests. I think I need to figure out how to move those to another branch.

## Notes

> None.
