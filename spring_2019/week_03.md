## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week, I was able to look at the front end and start thinking about what I wanted to work on. But I had trouble understanding what parts of the code required further work, so I wasn't able to come to a conclusion.

## This Week's Plan

> I intend to look at the visual design of the UI for now, and propose other designs.

## Anything Blocking?

> I'd like to understand the code well enough to find a point to work on.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
